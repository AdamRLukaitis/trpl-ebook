# 'The Rust Programming Language' as EBook

This repository contains stuff to convert [this book](http://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) to HTML, EPUB and PDF.

**[Download Links](http://killercup.github.io/trpl-ebook/)**

## DIY

Install:

- pandoc
- ruby
- XeLaTeX and probably some additional packages, I had to install (`sudo tlmgr install $pkg`) those:
    + framed
    + hyphenat
    + quotchap
- the DejaVu Sans Mono font

Then run:

```sh
$ ruby build.rb
```

Voil√°!
